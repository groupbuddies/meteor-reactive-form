#Reactive form

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/groupbuddies/meteor-reactive-form.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/groupbuddies/meteor-reactive-form)

reactive-form is a package to help with complex forms where fields of the same form are distributed in multiple templates and and templates are reused.

The idea is that there is an object shared across all templates. Each template can update the form and listen for changes.
